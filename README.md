# How to play FlashCards in the terminal!

## Fork This Repo

On the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.

## Setup

Clone down the forked repo (from your GitHub). Since you don't want to name the project "flashcards-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments):

```bash
git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
Now that you have the repo stored locally, you can play the game from inside this directory!

In the terminal, run:

```bash
node index.js
```

You will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback. You will play through the entire deck of cards and it will score percent of correct responses! 

Once the round is over it will kick you back out to the 'main' branch where you can begin again to try and beat your score.
